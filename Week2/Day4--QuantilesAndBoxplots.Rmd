### Activities 

1. Find the a value of body mass for which $30 \%$ of penguins are below that mass.

```{r}

```

2. Find the a value of body mass for which $60 \%$ of penguins are above that mass.

```{r}

```


3. Make a box plot for flipper length.

```{r}

```


4. Make a boxplot for body mass where each island is separated into it's own boxplot.

```{r}

```


5. How many penguins are in the study are not from Torgesen?



6. How many penguins in the study have a flipper length less than $190$ and a body mass greater than $4700$?
