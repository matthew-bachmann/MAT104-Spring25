## Difference of means

$$\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2} \sim N \left( \mu_1-\mu_2, \sqrt{\frac{(\sigma_1)^2}{n_1} + \frac{(\sigma_2)^2}{n_2}} \right) $$



When the population standard deviation is unknown for both groups, we use the sample standard deviation and the $t$-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the smaller of $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$.

1. A scientific experiment measured change in blood pressure due to a medication in a control and treatment group. In their measurements negative data indicates a decrease in blood pressure. The control group had an average decrease of $-1.4$ and the treatment group had an average decrease of $-4$. With $9$ people in each group and sample standard deviations $5.2$ and $2.4$ in the control and treatment respectively, does this data provide statistically significant evidence of the effectiveness of the medication?

$H_0: \mu_T = \mu_C$ or $\mu_T - \mu_C = 0$

$H_A: \mu_T < \mu_C$ or $\mu_T-\mu_C <0$


2. It is thought that middle school age boys and girls spend an equal time on average watching tv. A study is done for $25$ randomly selected children. The study had $16$ boys and $9$ girls. The $16$ boys watched tv for an average of $3.22$ hours per day with a sample standard deviation of $1$. The $9$ girls watched an average of two hours of television per day with a sample standard deviation of $.866$. Does the study suggest a statistically significant difference in the two population means using a significance level of $.05$?

3. $$\hat{p_1} = .34, \ \hat{p_2} = .38, \ n_1 = 52, \ n_2 =65$$

$$H_0:p_1 = p_2$$

$$H_A:p_1 \neq p_2$$
