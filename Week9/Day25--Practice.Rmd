1. It is believed that $40 \%$ of people pass their driving test on the first attempt. Suppose you think the percentage is greater than $40 \%$. So, you perform a hypothesis test and sample $100$ people. Of the sampled people, $47$ reply that they passed on their first attempt. Set up a hypothesis test and make a conclusion with a $10 \%$ significance level.

$H_0:$

$H_A:$

```{r}

```

2. If the true proportion of people pass their driving test on the first attempt is $52 \%$, what is the power of your test at detecting this difference?

3. Cadmium, a heavy metal, is toxic to animals. Mushrooms, however, are able to absorb and accumulate cadmium at high concentrations. The Czech and Slovak governments have set a safety limit for cadmium in dry vegetables at $0.5$ part per million (ppm). A hypothesis test is to be performed to decide whether the mean cadmium level in mushrooms is greater than the governmentâ€™s recommended limit. It is known that the population is normally distributed and has standard deviation $0.37$ ppm of cadmium. A sample of $12$ mushrooms has a mean cadmium level of $0.55$ ppm a significance level of $5 \%$. Does the data provide statistically significant evidence that the mean cadmium levels is higher than the goverment's recommend limit?

4. If the true average is $0.8$ ppm, what is the power of the test at detecting this?
